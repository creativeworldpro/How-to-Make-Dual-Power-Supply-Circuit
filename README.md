In this project, we’ll teach you making a dual power supply circuit. This circuit generates two different output voltages from a single input source. This circuit can ensure stable power supply to the device as well as it helps to prevent system damage. Many electronic circuits require a source of DC power. This dual power supply circuit mostly used for high quality amplifier circuit.

To make this circuit, at least we need to use two capacitors. Sometimes we need to use four, six or eight capacitors. The dual power supply provides positive as well as negative potential with the ground.

Transformer Pin Out

To make this dual power supply circuit, we are using a 12 volt 1.5 ampere transformer. All transformers have two sections. One is Primary section and the other one is secondary section. Primary section is for input voltage and secondary section is for output voltage. 220v AC cable is connected with primary section of transformer and 12v AC output from secondary section.

In the secondary section, there are three cables. If we count it’s cable as a like T1, T2 and T3. Here T1 and T2 contain AC 12v, T1 and T3 contain AC 24v, T2 and T3 contain AC 12v.


Circuit Connection – Step 1

To make this dual power supply circuit, 1st we make a bridge connection of these 4 diodes. We connect one diode anode terminal with another diode cathode terminal. Again make the same circuit connection. After this, we connect two diode anode terminals and connect other two diode cathode terminal. 


Circuit Connection – Step 2

We make a series connection with these two capacitors. That means, we connect one capacitor negative leg with another capacitor positive leg.

Now we connect diode positive leg with capacitor positive leg and connect diode negative leg with capacitor negative leg.
For power indicator, we need to connect a LED light.  We are using a red color LED light. The red LED light can glow with only (1.5-3) volt, for that we need to connect a resistor with this LED light. Now we connect 1 KΩ resistor with LED positive leg. Then we connect resistor with capacitor positive leg and then connect LED negative cable with transformer (T1) cable.


Circuit Connection – Step 3

Connect transformer cable with the circuit. We can use 12v or 24v transformer. We connect transformer T1 cable with diode anode and cathode leg, T2 cable with capacitor positive and negative leg, T3 cable with diode anode and cathode leg.


Circuit Connection – Step 4

For output voltage, now we need to connect three output cables with the circuit. We connect output positive cable with capacitor positive leg, connect output negative cable with capacitor negative leg and connect output ground cable with the place, where capacitor positive and negative leg is connected.
